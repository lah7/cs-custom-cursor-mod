# Custom Cursor Mod for Cities: Skylines

Replace the default cursor with your own graphic!

On Linux, this helps fix the tiny cursor on HiDPI screens (under X11, at least).


### Usage

Place a "CustomCursor.png" image into the root of your "Cities_Skylines" folder
(usually `SteamApps/common/`). The image should:

* Have a transparent background (alpha channel).
* No larger then 48x48 pixels.
* Saved in PNG format.

The cursor will change after loading a city.

If you wish to use the default cursor, but twice the size, use the
[default_2x.png](https://github.com/lah7/cs-custom-cursor-mod/raw/refs/heads/master/default_2x.png)
file enclosed in this repository.


### Install via Steam

[Subscribe on the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2650172411) then place a "CustomCursor.png" file in the game folder as
described above.


### Install outside of Steam

1. Go to your local mods folder (near your save data). On Linux, this is located here:

       ~/.local/share/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines/Addons/Mods

2. [Download a ZIP](https://github.com/lah7/cs-custom-cursor-mod/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) of this repository and extract into a folder, `CustomCursor`.

3. Place a "CustomCursor.png" file in the game folder as described above.
